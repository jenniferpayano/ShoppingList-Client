PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
------------------------
To plan this game, I knew that I would want to built an application that will help me keep track of grocery items.
When going into a store I usually loose track of what I want to get when I go into a store. Often
that shopping list includes many items at different stores. It would be nice to have a tracker
for the store and what I need to get at that store specifically to keep in budget. I think a lot of busy people get distracted by other things when going to a store and go above their budget.
