Description
------------
This is the shopping list application user insterface written in CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and JQuery by me [Jennifer Payano].
I wanted to create an application that could keep track of stores that I have attended and how much was spent. This will be substracted from the budget.

The deployed user interface application url: https://jenniferpayano.github.io/shoppinglist-ui/

PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
------------------------
To plan this game, I knew that I would want to built an application that will help me keep track of grocery items.
When going into a store I usually loose track of what I want to get when I go into a store. Often
that shopping list includes many items at different stores. It would be nice to have a tracker
for the store and what I need to get at that store specifically to keep in budget. I think a lot of busy people get distracted by other things when going to a store and go above their budget.
